Interpreting column names as follows:
p_value:	p-Value
other_allele:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
n:	Sample size
beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
effect_allele:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.

Reading sumstats from HP.sex.combined.GWAS.tsv.gz.short into memory 500000 SNPs at a time.
Read 1190955 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 183 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1190772 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1190772 SNPs remain).
Removed 2956 SNPs with N < 334550.0 (1187816 SNPs remain).
Median value of beta was 0.0, which seems sensible.
